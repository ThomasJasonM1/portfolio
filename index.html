                You may not guess by this dapper picture of me in a button down shirt, but this sweet "young" man
                went to school for underwater construction. Yes, I was once a guy who got my hands dirty, dipped tobacco, 
                and cursed like a sailor. It turns out that my mother's prayers worked and I am now persuing a career as a 
                software developer; and loving it!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are ever looking for me outside of office hours, I can promise that you will not find me inside any
                building. I love to camp, hike, play sports and fully enjoy this beautiful planet. When I think of the perfect day,
                I'm reminded of a beautiful (but dangerous) hike I took last year called

                Back in real life I work at a small tech company in Frisco, Texas. We develop software that sends out automated
                calls and text messages as part of an emergency notification system. I support the platform that sends out the 
                messages. I am lucky to work for a company that lets me experiment with my skills and morph into an engineer as time
                goes on.
            </p>
            <p>
                All in all, I'm a lucky guy who lives a life I love every day!
